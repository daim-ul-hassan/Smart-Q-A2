"""
main.py - Smart Book Q&A Crew (All-in-One)

Agents, tasks, crew, and entry point in a single file.

Three agents work in sequence:
  1. Document Retriever - searches the vector store for relevant chunks
  2. Answer Writer     - writes a clear answer from the chunks
  3. Quality Checker   - verifies the answer is correct

Before running, make sure you have:
  1. Added your PDF or TXT files to the 'docs/' folder
  2. Run 'python rag_setup.py' to build the vector store
  3. Created a .env file with your GOOGLE_API_KEY

Usage:
    python main.py
